\begin{document}

This document and the associated file Notation\_Guide.xlsx will serve as the official guide to notation used throughout the model.  The goal is to make sure variables and parameters have intuitive and consistent notation.

The notation will be grouped into three tables: endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and parameters.  Note that other versions of the variables used here will exist.  In particular, ``hats" over variables (e.g., $\hat{D}_{t}$) will denote the ratio of the variable to total economic output (e.g., $\frac{D_{t}}{Y_{t}}$) and ``bars" over variables denote the steady-state version of that variable (e.g., the steady state read interest rate is given by $\bar{r}$).  SHOULD WE USE ``tilde" for stationarized variables??  It seems to already be taking for the working age population variables...
