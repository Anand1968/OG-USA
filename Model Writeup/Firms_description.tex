\section{The Firm's Problem}

The objective of the firm is to maximize firm value.  Firms do this by choosing investment and labor demand and well as financial policies such as new equity issues, dividend distributions, and borrowing.  The problem of the firm is the same in each industry, $m$, and in each sector, $C\in\{\text{corporate},\text{non-corporate}\}$, though the parameters defining the problem vary across industry and sector.  Finally, we assume that each industry and sector is competitive, meaning that firms earn zero economic profits.  Since the problem of the first is the same in each industry, we omit the subscripts $m$, and $C$ that accompany each variable and parameter for the description of the firm's problem.

\subsection{The Value of the Firm}

Without aggregate uncertainty, asset market equilibrium requires that the after-tax returns on all assets be equalized if households are to simultaneously hold equities and government bonds.  The after-tax, nominal return on holding a risk-free government bond is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:r}
r_{t}=(1-\tau^{i}_{t})i_{t},
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent Where $i_{t}$ is the nominal interest rate on bonds.  Thus the return on holding corporate equity must equal $r_{t}$ in equilibrium:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:equity_eqm}
r_{t}=(1-\tau^{i}_{t})i_{t}=\frac{(1-\tau^{d}_{t})DIV_{t}+(1-\tau^{g}_{t})(V_{t+1}-V_{t}-VN_{t})}{V_{t}}
\end{equation}

The first part of the numerator are the dividends from holding equity shares in the firm.  The second part are the capital gains from holding equity, which are diluted by the issuance of new shares, $VN_{t}$.  We can rearrange this equation \ref{eqn:equity_eqm} to solve for $V_{t+1}$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:v_t1}
\begin{split}
V_{t+1}&=\frac{V_{t}(1-\tau^{i}_{t})i_{t}-(1-\tau^{d}_{t})DIV_{t}}{(1-\tau^{g}_{t})}+V_{t}+VN_{t} \\
 & = V_{t}\underbrace{\left(1+\frac{(1-\tau^{i}_{t})i_{t}}{(1-\tau^{g}_{t})}\right)}_{\text{Let this be }1+\theta_{t}} + VN_{t} - \frac{(1-\tau^{d}_{t})}{(1-\tau^{g}_{t})}DIV_{t} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent Now we then solve for $V_{t}$ by repeatedly substituting for $V_{t+1}$ and applying the transversality condition ($\lim_{T \to \infty} \prod_{t=1}^{T}(1+\theta_{t})V_{T}=0$):

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:solve_vs}
\begin{split}
& V_{t}=\frac{V_{t+1}}{(1+\theta_{t})} - \frac{VN_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t}}\right)DIV_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})} \\
\implies &  V_{t}=\frac{V_{t+2}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})} - \frac{VN_{t+1}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t+1}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t+1}}\right)DIV_{t+1}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})} - \frac{VN_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t}}\right)DIV_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})} \\
\implies &  V_{t}= \frac{V_{t+3}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})(1+\theta_{t+2})} - \frac{VN_{t+2}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})(1+\theta_{t+2})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t+2}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t+2}}\right)DIV_{t+2}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})(1+\theta_{t+2})} \\
& - \frac{VN_{t+1}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t+1}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t+1}}\right)DIV_{t+1}}{(1+\theta_{t})(1+\theta_{t+1})} - \frac{VN_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})}  + \frac{\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t}}\right)DIV_{t}}{(1+\theta_{t})} \\
& \text{and so on...} \\
\implies & V_{t}=\underbrace{\prod_{\nu=t}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right)V_{\infty}}_{=0 \text{ by transversality condition}} - \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right)\left[VN_{u} - \left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{u}}{1-\tau^{g}_{u}}\right)DIV_{u}\right]\\
\implies & V_{t}= \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right)\left[ \left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{u}}{1-\tau^{g}_{u}}\right)DIV_{u}-VN_{u}\right]\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Thus, firm value is a function of the discounted, after-tax value of dividends, less the discounted value of new share issuance, which dilutes the value of the shares held at time $t$. 

\subsection{The Sequence Problem of the Firm}

To solve for the Bellman equation defining the dynamic optimization problem of the firm, we first solve for $VN_{t}$, the value of shares issued in period $t$.  To do this, we use the cash flow identity of the firm: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vn}
EARN_{t}+BN_{t}+VN_{t}=DIV_{t}+I_{t}(p^{K}_{t}+\Phi_{t})+TE_{t}, 
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent where $EARN_{t}$ are earnings before depreciation, corporate income taxes, and adjustment costs, but after property taxes; $BN_{t}$ are new bond issues, $I_{t}$ is investment, $p^{K}_{t}$ is the price of capital, $\Phi_{t}$ are adjustment costs, and $TE_{t}$ are total corporate income taxes (all in period $t$).  Earnings are the difference between the revenues from selling firm output, $X_{t}$, and the costs of labor, debt, and property taxes.  Specifically:    

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:earn}
EARN_{t}=p_{t}X_{t}-w_{t}EL_{t}-i_{t}B_{t}-\tau^{P}_{t}K_{t},
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent where output, $X_{t}$, is determined by a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. Note that we notate the capital stock that is determined when period $t$ begins at $K_{t}$.  The CES production function for the firm is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:prod_fun}
F(K_{t},EL_{t})=X_{t} = \left[(\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(K_{t})^{(\epsilon-1)/\epsilon_{C}}+(1-\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(EL_{t})^{(\epsilon_{C}-1)/\epsilon_{C}}\right]^{(\epsilon_{C}/(\epsilon_{C}-1))}
\end{equation}

New debt issues are solved for by the assumption of a constant debt-to-capital ratio (and the law of motion for the capital stock):
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:debt}
BN_{t}=B_{t+1} - B_{t} \text{ and } B_{t}=bK_{t} \text{ by assumption} 
\end{equation}

The law of motion of the capital stock is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lom_capital}
K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_{t} + I_{t}
\end{equation}

Adjustment costs are assumed to be a quadratic function of deviations from the steady-state investment rate:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:adj_cost}
\Phi_{t}=\frac{p_{t}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)\left(\frac{I_{t}}{K_{t}}-\mu\right)^{2}}{\left(\frac{I_{t}}{K_{t}}\right)}
\end{equation}

Corporate income taxes are given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:corp_tax}
\begin{split}
TE_{t}= & \tau^{b}_{t}\left[p_{t}X_{t}-w_{t}EL_{t}-f_{e}p^{K}_{t}I_{t}-\Phi_{t}I_{t}-f_{i}i_{t}B_{t}-f_{p}\delta b K_{t}+f_{b}bp^{K}_{t}I_{t}-f_{d}\delta^{\tau}K^{\tau}_{t}-\tau^{p}_{t}K_{t}\right] \\
& +\underbrace{\tau^{ic}_{t}p^{K}_{t}I_{t}}_{\text{not in Zodrow and Diamond (2013), added to account for investment tax credits as policy}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent  Note that we are assuming that investment may or may not be deductible (depending upon the dummy variable $f_{e}$), but that investment adjustment costs are always deductible (i.e., they are not preceded by $f_{e}$).  Under a pre-pay consumption tax system, investments are not deductible from the tax base.  Whether or not adjustment costs are deductible under a pre-pay consumption tax depends upon what you think these costs derive from.  For example, if adjustment costs are from retraining employees to use new equipment, then these costs may be deductible under a consumption tax system (pre or post-pay) because they would likely be in the form of wage/labor costs. It's not clear how best to handle this and I believe \citet{DZ2013} are inconsistent on this point.  The other indicator variables, $f_{i}$, $f_{p}$, $f_{b}$, and $f_{d}$, allow for various consumption tax policies to be incorporated into the model.  The parameter $f_{i}=1$ if interest on debt is deductible and 0 if not.  The parameter $f_{p}$ is equal to one the principle on corporate borrowing is deductible from the corporate income tax based.  Principle on loans would be deductible in a post-pay consumption tax system.  The parameter $f_{b}$ is equal to one if the proceeds from firm borrowing is included in the corporate tax base.  Such proceeds would be included in a pre-pay consumption tax system.  The parameter $f_{d}$ is equal to one if capital can be depreciated and zero if not.  For example, in a post-pay consumption tax framework, $f_{e}=1$ and $f_{d}=0$.  

The tax basis of the capital stock is given by $K^{\tau}_{t}$.  The law of motion for the tax basis of the capital stock is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lom_taxcapital}
K^{\tau}_{t+1}=(1-\delta^{\tau})(K^{\tau}_{t} + (1-f_{e})p^{K}_{t}I_{t})
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent Note how we form the law of motion for the tax basis.  The above formulation accounts for the fact that investment in year $t$ receives a depreciation deduction in year $t$.\footnote{The IRS specifies a partial year rule, where one deducts the value of investment proportional to the amount of the year in which the asset was in place.  We ignore this detail and assume all assets are in place for the entire year.}  We can think about modifying this so that you get no deduction in the year the investment is made, which may or may not be more consistent with the ``time to build" built into the law of motion for the physical capital stock.

Dividends are determined by the assumption that dividends are a constant fraction of pre-tax earnings.  In particular, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:div}
DIV_{t}=\zeta(EARN_{t}-TE_{t}-p_{t}\delta K_{t})
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations \ref{eqn:vn} - \ref{eqn:div} into Equation \ref{eqn:solve_vs}  (and letting $\Omega_{t}=1 - \zeta + \zeta\left(\frac{1-\tau^{d}_{t}}{1-\tau^{g}_{t}}\right) = \left[\zeta(1-\tau^{d}_{t}) + (1-\zeta)(1-\tau^{g}_{t})\right]/(1-\tau^{g}_{t})$), one can write the value of the firm at time $t$ as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vs}
\begin{split}
V_{t} = &  \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right) (1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}(p_{u}X_{u}-w_{s}EL_{s})  \\ 
 & - K_{t} \left\{(1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}\tau^{p}_{u}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u})i_{u}\Omega_{u}b-\delta(p_{u}-b-\Omega_{u}(p_{u}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u}b))\right\}  \\
 & - I_{u}\left\{p^{K}_{t}-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u}\right\} \\
 & - \Omega_{u}f_{d}\tau^{b}_{u}\delta^{\tau}K^{\tau}_{u}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent Note that $K^{\tau}_{u}$ tracks depreciation deductions in in all periods $u=t,...,\infty$.  Future depreciation deductions on the tax basis of the capital stock in existence at time $u$ do not affect investment decisions at time $u$ (or forward) since the tax basis is predetermined.\footnote{Note that if there were financial frictions (e.g. a borrowing constraint or costly external finance), then investment would be dependent on cash flow and would then be affected by changes in the value of deductions for the existing capital basis.}  However, future depreciation deductions for investments made at time $u$ do affect investment decisions (since they lower the after-tax cost of investment).  Therefore it's useful to distinguish between old and new capital. 

The time $u$ value of future depreciation deductions on the capital stock existing at the beginning of period $u$ is given by $K^{\tau}_{u-1}$.  We can determine this value as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:z}
\begin{split}
f_{d}Z_{u}K^{\tau}_{u-1} &=  \sum^{\infty}_{j=u} \prod_{\nu=u}^{j} \left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu})}\right)f_{d}\Omega_{j}\tau^{b}_{j}\delta^{\tau}(1-\delta^{\tau})^{j-u}K^{\tau}_{u} \\
&= f_{d} K^{\tau}_{u-1} \underbrace{\sum^{\infty}_{j=u} \prod_{\nu=u}^{j} \left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu})}\right)f_{d}\Omega_{j}\tau^{b}_{j}\delta^{\tau}(1-\delta^{\tau})^{j-u}}_{Z_{u}} \\
& = f_{d} K^{\tau}_{u-1} Z_{u},
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent where $Z_{u}$ is the net present value of future depreciation deductions per dollar of investment.  With this, we derive the time $u$ value of future depreciation deductions on investments made at time $u$, $I^{\tau}_{u}$.  These are given by $f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u}I_{u}$.  Now we can rewrite Equation \ref{eqn:vs} describing the value of the firm at time $t$ as: 

 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vs_w_z}
\begin{split}
V_{t} = &  \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right) (1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}(p_{u}X_{u}-w_{u}EL_{u})  \\ 
 & - K_{t} \left\{(1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}\tau^{p}_{u}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u})i_{u}\Omega_{u}b-\delta(p_{u}-b-\Omega_{u}(p_{u}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u}b))\right\}  \\
 & - I_{u}\left\{1-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u}\right\} \\
 &  + f_{d}Z_{t}K^{\tau}_{t-1} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Using the above equations, we see all endogenous variables determining the value of the firm result from the firm's investment and effective labor demand.The sequence problem of the firm is thus: 

 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:firm_seq_prob}
\begin{split}
V_{t} = &   \max_{\{I_{u},K_{u+1}\}^{\infty}_{u=t}}   \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right) (1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}(p_{u}X_{u}-w_{u}EL_{u})  \\ 
 & - K_{t} \left\{(1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}\tau^{p}_{u}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u})i_{u}\Omega_{u}b-\delta(p_{u}-b-\Omega_{u}(p_{u}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u}b))\right\}  \\
 & - I_{u}\left\{1-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u}\right\} \\
 &  + f_{d}Z_{t}K^{\tau}_{t-1} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The Lagrangian to the firm's problem at time $t$ can be written as:

 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lagrangian}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}_{t} = \max_{\{I_{u},K_{u+1}\}^{\infty}_{u=t}} &  \sum_{u=t}^{\infty} \prod_{\nu=t}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{\nu}}\right) (1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}(p_{u}X_{u}-w_{s}EL_{s})  \\ 
 & - K_{s} \left\{(1-\tau^{b}_{u})\Omega_{u}\tau^{pC}_{u}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u})i_{u}\Omega_{u}b-\delta(p_{u}-b-\Omega_{u}(p_{u}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u}b))\right\}  \\
 & - I_{u}\left\{1-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u}\right\} \\
 &  + f_{d}Z_{s}K^{\tau}_{s-1} + q_{u}((1-\delta)K_{u} + I_{u}-K_{u+1})\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The FOCs w.r.t. investment (which hold $\forall \ u$) are given by:
 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:foc_i}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{t}}{\partial I_{u}} & = -\left\{1-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u}\right\} - I_{u}(1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\frac{\partial \Phi_{u}}{\partial I_{u}} + q_{u} = 0 \\
\implies & q_{u}  = 1-b+\Omega_{u}f_{b}\tau^{b}_{u}b-\Omega_{u}f_{e}\tau^{b}_{u} - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u} +  I_{u}(1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\frac{\partial \Phi_{u}}{\partial I_{u}} \\
\implies & q_{u}  = 1-b-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u}(f_{e}-f_{b}b) - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u} +  I_{u}(1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\frac{\partial \Phi_{u}}{\partial I_{u}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent\noindent The Euler equation described in Equation \ref{eqn:foci} relates Tobin's $q$, given by $q_{u}$, to the marginal costs of investment.  Tobin's $q$ defines the marginal change in firm value for a dollar of investment. The FOC for investment says that the firm invests until the marginal benefit (the LHS of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_i}) is equal to the marginal cost of investment (the RHS of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_i}).  The cost of investment in the absence of taxes and frictions is equal to 1 (the first term on the RHS of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_i}) since investment goods are the numeraire.  The second term reflects the reduction in the cost of capital due to debt financing.  The third term on the RHS of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_i} is the change in the cost of capital due to debt being included or excluded from business entity-level income taxes.  The fourth term reflects the reduction in the cost of capital due to depreciation deductions.  The last term reflects the component of the cost of capital that is due to adjustment costs (net of the expensing of adjustment costs for tax purposes).
% \begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:opt_i}
%\begin{split}
% q_{u}  = 1-b-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u}(f_{e}-f_{b}b) - f_{d}(1-f_{e})Z_{u} + (1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\Phi_{u} +  I_{u}(1-\Omega_{u}\tau^{b}_{u})\frac{\partial \Phi_{u}}{\partial I_{u}} 
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}



The FOCs w.r.t. capital one period ahead are given by:
 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:foc_k}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{s}}{\partial K_{u+1}}  =  \prod_{\nu=s}^{u}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta{\nu}}\right)\left[-q_{u}\right] \\
 & +  \prod_{\nu=s}^{u+1}\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta{\nu}}\right)\left[(1-\delta)q_{u+1} +p_{u+1} \frac{\partial X_{u+1}}{\partial K_{u+1}}- \{(1-\tau^{b}_{u+1})\Omega_{u+1}\tau^{pC}_{u+1}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u+1})i_{u+1}\Omega_{u+1}b-\delta(p_{u+1}-b-\Omega_{u+1}(p_{u+1}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u+1}b))\}   \right] = 0 \\
& \implies  q_{u}  = \left(\frac{1}{1+\theta_{u+1}}\right)\\
& \left[(1-\delta)q_{u+1} +p_{u+1} \frac{\partial X_{u+1}}{\partial K_{u+1}}- \{(1-\tau^{b}_{u+1})\Omega_{u+1}\tau^{pC}_{u+1}+(1-f_{i}\tau^{i}_{u+1})i_{u}\Omega_{u+1}b-\delta(p_{u+1}-b-\Omega_{u+1}(p_{u+1}-f_{p}\tau^{b}_{u+1}b))\}   \right]  \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We should be able to solve for $I_{u}$, $K_{u+1}$, and $q_{u}$ with Equations \ref{eqn:lom_capital}, \ref{eqn:opt_i},  and \ref{eqn:foc_k}.  We can then use  $q_{u}$ to solve for $V_{u}$ as we show next.

As \citet{Hayashi1982} shows,  with a constant returns to scale production function and quadratic adjustment costs, we can device that marginal $q$ is equal to average $q$.  Note that in our case, we must make an adjustment for the value of depreciation deductions on the tax basis of the capital stock.  Relation between marginal $q$, $q_{u}$, and average $q$, $Q_{u}$:
 \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:avg_q}
\begin{split}
q_{u}=\frac{[V_{u}-f_{d}Z_{u}K^{\tau}_{u-1}]}{K_{u}} \text{ and } Q_{u}=\frac{V_{u}}{K_{u}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Necessary equations}
To solve the model, we want to get the optimal choices of labor and investment demand by firms.  Labor demand is determined through an intratemporal trade off between the costs and benefits of labor.  The necessary condition for the optimal choice of labor is: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:foc_l}
p^{C}_{s}\frac{\partial F(K^{C}_{s},EL^{C}_{s})}{\partial EL^{C}_{s}}=w_{s}
\end{equation}

Investment is more complicated, as it presents an intertemporal tradeoff between the costs of investment today and the benefits of a higher capital stock tomorrow.  Once we have investment, all other endogenous variables follow from various accounting identities and assumptions on financial policies.

To derive the necessary conditions for investment, we need to first solve for the value of the firm as a function of the state variables (noted above) and the choice of investment. We do this by substituting in the various accounting identities to our equation for firm value.

\section{Solving the model}

We'll solve the model in two steps.  First, we solve for the steady state prices and allocations.  Next, we iterate backwards solving for prices and allocations along the transition path to the steady state.

\subsection{Solving for the steady state}

On the supply side (with one sector), we have to solve for the factor prices, $\bar{i}$ and $bar{w}$ (the price of output $\bar{p}^{C}$ is normalized to one), the shadow price of capital, $\bar{q}^{C}$, and the allocations $\bar{EL}^{C}$, $\bar{K}^{C}$, $\bar{I}^{C}$.  From these all the other variables follow trivially.  

Start by solving for the steady-states of Equations \ref{eqn:opt_i} and \ref{eqn:foc_k}.  Equation \ref{eqn:opt_i} becomes:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:opt_i_ss}
\bar{q}^{C}=\underbrace{1-b^{C}-\bar{\Omega}^{C}\bar{\tau}^{b}(f_{e}-f_{b}b^{C})-f_{d}(1-f_{e})\bar{Z}^{C}}_{\text{function of only parameters}}
\end{equation}

This yields the solution to $\bar{q}^{C}$.

Next, consider the steady-state of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_k}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:foc_k_ss}
\bar{q}^{C}=\frac{1}{1+\bar{\theta}}\left[(1-\delta^{C})\bar{q}^{C} + \frac{\partial \bar{X}^{C}}{\partial \bar{K}^{C}} - \{(1-\bar{\tau}^{b})\bar{\Omega}^{C}\bar{\tau}^{pC} + (1-f_{i}\bar{\tau}^{i})\bar{i}\bar{\Omega}^{C}b^{C} - \delta^{C}(1-b^{C}-\bar{\Omega}^{C}(1-f_{p}\bar{\tau}^{b}b^{C}))\}\right]
\end{equation}

We can rearrange this and solve for the steady-state marginal product of capital in sector $C$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:mpk_ss}
\frac{\partial \bar{X}^{C}}{\partial \bar{K}^{C}} = (\bar{\theta}+\delta^{C})\bar{q}^{C} + (1-\bar{\tau}^{b})\bar{\Omega}^{C}\bar{\tau}^{pC} + (1-f_{i}\bar{\tau}^{i})\bar{i}\bar{\Omega}^{C}b^{C} - \delta^{C}(1-b^{C}-\bar{\Omega}^{C}(1-f_{p}\bar{\tau}^{b}b^{C}))
\end{equation}

Notice that given Equation \ref{eqn:opt_i_ss}, the RHS to the above equation is function of parameters and the steady state nominal interest rate, $\bar{i}$.  The LHS of the equation is a function of $\bar{K}^{C}$ and $\bar{EL}^{C}$.

I think we can use the following to identify the SS values of the variables of interest:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bar{i}$ will be determined by the SS of the household's Euler equations (I think this can be done as described in the HH sol'n method)
\item $\bar{w}$ will be determined by the SS of the household's FOCs for labor supply ((I think this can be done as described in the HH sol'n method)
\item $\bar{q}^{C}$ is determined by Equation \ref{eqn:opt_i_ss}
\item $\bar{EL}^{C}$ is determined by the SS version of Equation \ref{eqn:foc_l}, plus $\bar{w}$
\item $\bar{K}^{C}$ is determined by Equation \ref{eqn:mpk_ss} and $\bar{i}$
\item $\bar{I}^{C}$ is then solved for using the steady state law of motion for capital $\implies \bar{I}^{C}=\delta^{C}\bar{K}^{C}$
\end{enumerate}

In solving for $\bar{EL}^{C}$ and $\bar{K}^{C}$, note that we'll have use the MPK and the MPL simultaneously.  Given our production function, we have:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:mpk}
\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial K^{C}_{u}} = \left[(\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(K^{C}_{u})^{(\epsilon_{C}-1)/\epsilon_{C}}+(1-\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(EL^{C}_{u})^{(\epsilon_{C}-1)/\epsilon_{C}}\right]^{1/(\epsilon_{C}-1)}(\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(K^{C}_{u})^{-1/\epsilon_{C}}
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:mpl}
\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial EL^{C}_{u}} = \left[(\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(K^{C}_{u})^{(\epsilon_{C}-1)/\epsilon_{C}}+(1-\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(EL^{C}_{u})^{(\epsilon_{C}-1)/\epsilon_{C}}\right]^{1/(\epsilon_{C}-1)}(1-\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(EL^{C}_{u})^{-1/\epsilon_{C}}
\end{equation}

We know that, at an optimum, the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage rate, and the marginal revenue product of capital equals a function of the interest rate, marginal $q$, and the model parameters.  Call this function $g(i_{u},q^{C}_{u},q^{C}_{u-1},\Theta)$.  We thus have $p^{C}_{u}\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial EL^{C}_{u}} =w_{u}$ and $p^{C}_{u}\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial K^{C}_{u}}=g(i_{u},q^{C}_{u},q^{C}_{u-1},\Theta)$.  Dividing these two equations, we have:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cap_lab_ratio}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial K^{C}_{u}}}{\frac{\partial X^{C}_{u}}{\partial EL^{C}_{u}}} =\frac{(\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(K^{C}_{u})^{-1/\epsilon_{C}}}{(1-\gamma_{C})^{1/\epsilon_{C}}(EL^{C}_{u})^{-1/\epsilon_{C}}}-=\frac{g(i_{u},q^{C}_{u},q^{C}_{u-1},\Theta)}{w_{u}} \\
& \implies \frac{K^{C}_{u}}{EL^{C}_{u}} =\frac{(1-\gamma_{C})}{\gamma_{C}}\left(\frac{w_{u}} {g(i_{u},q^{C}_{u},q^{C}_{u-1},\Theta)}\right)^{\epsilon_{C}} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We can use the SS version of Equation \ref{eqn:cap_lab_ratio} to solve for capital as function of labor (and $\bar{q}, \bar{i}, \bar{w}$), and then use that in the SS version of Equation \ref{eqn:mpl} to solve for labor as s function of $\bar{q}, \bar{i}, \bar{w}$.  We then go back to the SS version of Equation \ref{eqn:cap_lab_ratio} to get the SS choice of capital as a function of $\bar{q}, \bar{i}, \bar{w}$.

All of the above will work for each sector in a model with any number of sectors (though care has to be taken to include the prices of output and capital in those other sectors, since only one sector's output can be the numeraire).

\subsection{Solving for the transition path}

I believe we can just use the Euler equations to go backwards in time, from the SS back along the transition path to $t=0$.  Assume period $T$ is the SS,  The solution would look like the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Equation \ref{eqn:foc_k} to solve for the for $q^{C}_{T-1}$ since we have the solution to the RHS of the equation after we've solved for the SS.
\item Use the law of motion for capital to find: $K^{C}_{T-1}=\frac{K^{C}_{T}-I^{C}_{T-1}}{(1-\delta^{C})}=\frac{\bar{K}^{C}-I^{C}_{T-1}}{(1-\delta^{C})}$
\item Use Equation \ref{eqn:opt_i} and the value of $q^{C}_{T-1}$ to find $I^{C}_{T-1}$ (and $K^{C}_{T-1}$ given the law of motion relationship.
\item Given $w_{T-1}$ we can use the FOC for labor demand to find $EL^{C}_{T-1}$
\item Given $i_{T-1}$ we can use Equation \ref{eqn:foc_k} to solve for $q^{C}_{T-2}$ 
\item We then repeat the above steps until we work back to $t=0$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Roadmap for extensions}

Possible order or model extensions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add industries/goods	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Try to do this along the lines of \citet{FG1993} with composite consumption and production goods.  Important additions might include health care and a carbon intensive sector (e.g. utilities, transport).  Important goods would be health services, large excise items (gasoline, alcohol, cigarettes), carbon intensive goods (e.g. utilities, transport), food 	
	\item Maybe be costly to solve firm problem for many sectors.  GE price vector may be large too, but \citet{FG1993}) suggest that still just w and r (for each year) that need
	\end{itemize}
\item Add types of capital	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Try to do this along the lines of \citet{FG1993} with composite capital in firm production function, but where capital can change type costlessly.	
	\item Not sure how/if this works in dynamic model where keep track of old capital.
	\end{itemize}
\item Add profits via some markup	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Want this so have supranormal returns, which are differentially affected by taxes. 
	\item See macro models of the markup, but want to just get markup that is a function of the elasticity of substitution.	
	\end{itemize}
\item Endogenize debt finance.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Have a cost to bankruptcy - use debt until this cost negates the tax advantage.
	\end{itemize}	
\item Endogenize payout policy	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Want to at have dividends respond to dividend tax rate (e.g. by at least being done cash after investment made - since invest a function of div tax rate). This is easy.  Harder I think is to fully endogenize so that firm considers the value of dividends to owners after tax vs the value of the dollar inside the firm.
	\end{itemize}	
\item Open economy	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item First thing to do here is to have some capital mobility in the model.	
	\end{itemize}
\item Have multiple types of labor (skilled/unskilled) in production function	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Only if have endogenous human capital accumulation.  
	\item Would like to see how taxes on capital affect capital/labor mix to uncover distribution of incidence of taxes by industry and individuals.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


Some features that might be interesting, but may not pass a cost-benefit test to adding into the model:	
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stochastic profitability shocks	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item So can account for loss carry forward/back.
	\item Would need to have idiosyncratic shocks over firms in an industry.   
	\item Think we'd have to solve the firm problem a lot more times and not sure how this interacts in GE with different type of capital etc.
	\end{itemize}
\item Have a more serious model of income shifting by having some behavior where move profits offshore	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Not sure how to do even in open economy model.	
	\end{itemize}
\item Endogenize entity choice.		
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Makes firm problem much harder.  
	\item Not sure how to calibrate elasticities, but Prisinzano and Pearce at OTA might have some estimates to help.
	\end{itemize}
\item Pollution externalities	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item It'd be cool to be able to do some policy experiments with Pigouvian taxes like \citet{BM1983}
	\end{itemize}.	
\item Model evasion and avoidance	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Perhaps just have some elasticity for reported income with respect to the marginal tax rate that scales actual income.	
	\item DeBacker, Heim, Tran, and Yuskavage can measure with audit data.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
