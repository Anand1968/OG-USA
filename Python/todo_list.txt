Income file:
-change ability matrix:
	-get data from IRS (jason)

		-add samples to the data
		-use glob to import all data at once

Demographic file:

SS file:

TPI file:
-incidental bequests

run_model file:

Documentation:
-document ability, demographic, SS, TPI, and run_SS_TPI file changes in python
-once everything is working, update the draft pictures
	-make sure the parameter values are correct (especially T)
	-say  that rho=1 for s>=80
	-Lpath_TPI graph?
-add documentation to draft about demographics

Other Problems:
-model doesn't converge if S<4 or S>80 (or in increments of less than one years length)
