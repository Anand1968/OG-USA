Stationary Folder:

Income file:
-change ability matrix:
	-get data from IRS (jason)
	-if that doesn't happen:
		-add samples to the data
		-use glob to import all data at once
	-either way, extrapolate age 80-100 values

Demographic file:
-eigvalue not working
-add children changes if S<60
-allow for S=80 (people die at 100)
-unequal bin sizes

SS file:
-unequal bin sizes
-mortality risk
-accidental bequests
-incidental bequests

TPI file:
-not working for J=7
-unequal bin sizes
-mortality risk
-accidental bequests
-incidental bequests


run_model file:

Documentation:
-document ability, demographic, SS, TPI, and run_SS_TPI file changes in python
-change source for fertility data
-once everything is working, update the draft pictures
	-make sure the parameter values are correct (especially T)
	-say  that rho=1 for s>=60
	-Lpath_TPI graph?
-add documentation to draft about demographics

Other Problems:
-model doesn't converge if S<4 or S>60 (or in increments of less than one years length)
