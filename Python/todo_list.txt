Stationary Folder:

Income file:
-change ability matrix:
	-get data from IRS (jason)
	-if that doesn't happen:
		-add samples to the data
		-use glob to import all data at once
	-either way, extrapolate age 80-100 values

Demographic file:
-what year are the fertility rates? can we get 2010?
-solve the multiple eigenvector problem (if 2, just use the last entry ofomega, and find the closest one)
-add children
	-add changes it S<60
-allow for S=80 (people die at 100)
-fit the fertility distribution at the lower end
-since we'll always be dealing with 1 yr or fewer increments, ditch the polyfits if mortality/immigration data extends to age 100 (otherwise, we'll need it)(but if we use it, know that sur_rate can be greater than 1 on occasion)

SS file:

TPI file:
-error when J!=1
-initial guess of time path should resemble a log function (or -log for L)
-K0 is really low once omega_0 is involved

run_model file:
-delete pyc files after completion

Documentation:
-document ability, demographic, SS, TPI, and run_SS_TPI file changes in python
-once everything is working, update the draft pictures
	-make sure the parameter values are correct (especially T)
	-say  that rho=1 for s>=60
	-Lpath_TPI graph?
-add documentation to draft about demographics

Other Problems:
-model doesn't converge if S<4 or S>60 (or in increments of less than one years length)
