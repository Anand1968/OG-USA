AEI/BYU Dynamic Tax Scoring Model
=================================

A Brigham Young University Macroeconomics and Computational Laboratory project in conjunction with the Open Source Policy Center at the American Enterprise Institute.

Abstract
========
This project builds, calibrates and simulates the effects of changes in various taxes on the U.S. economy in the contect of a large macro OLG model.  Our particular emphasis is on how the stream of tax revenues changes over time.

The BYU-AEI model is similar to the Zodrow-Diamond (ZD) model in being a computable CGE-OLG model.  We solve as ZD do using the Auerbach-Kolikoff time-path iteration method.

Demographics
------------
- Households live for a maximum of 100 years. (ZD use 55-year-lived agents)
- They become economically active at age 20, retire at age 65, and die by age 100.
- We explicitly consider mortality risk in our model.  (ZD have no mortality risk)
- The law of large numbers guarantees that the number of households in each cohort is perfectly predictable.
- We control for new births and immigration. (ZD use a fixed population growth rate)
- We include both accidental and intended bequests

Households
----------
- N different ability levels which are fixed at birth. (ZD use 12 ability levels)
- Different ability types have different age profiles for their labor productivity.  (Same as ZD)
- Unintentional bequest are distributed to other agents of the same ability type at the beginning of the next period. (ZD have no mortality risk and thus no unintentional bequests)
- Households that live to the final age will leave an intentional bequest which is modelled as an additional term in their utility function. (Same as ZD)
- Households optimally choose their labor supply, consumption, and savings each period.
  - We will likely allow for consumption of 12 goods (DZ have 4 goods), including health care, energy, and housing, which have special treatment in the tax code.
- They are subject to:
  - an income tax
  - a payroll tax on wage income only which funds a social security benefit for retired households
  - a consumption tax
  - potentially a wealth tax
- Household statutory marginal income tax rates are based on current income (ZD base tax rates on life-time income)

Firms
-----
- Maximize the discounted present value of all future profit streams.
  - Firm value and thus investment incentives are affected by tax policy.
- Firms acquire capital via investment and hire labor.
- Firms finance investment with retained earnings, debt, and new equity issuance.
- Likely more about 12 different sectors (a sector is represented by an industry-business entity type (corp/non-corp) combination) (ZD have four sectors)
  - Will include corporate and non-corporate sectors
  - Will include a multinational sector.  These will be corporate businesses and will probably separately model the manufacturing and services industries.
  - Industries not yet determined, but likely to include manufacturing, services (ex health care), health care, energy, housing industries.
  - Likely have with corporate and non-corporate sectors in each industry.

Government
----------
- For 10 years the government collects whatever tax revenue is implied by the chosen tax structure.
- After 10 years spending cuts are imposed so that the debt to GDP ratio stabilizes in the long run. 

Market Clearing
---------------
- Markets are perfectly competitive. (Same as ZD)
- The economy is closed to the rest of the world (same as ZDâ€™s simple model).
  - The exception to this are multinational businesses, who can use the rest of the world to shift profits overseas.
